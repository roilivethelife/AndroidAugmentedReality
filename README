Hi!

This project it's my Final Degree Project, an augmented reality app for Android.

Tools/Libraries Used:
Android Studio 2.2.3
Vuforia Sdk V6.0.117 (oct2016)

HOW IT WORKS
First you have to select the room where you are.
Then the camera stars and it try to look the reference marker.
Once the app track the marker it will know the position of the phone in the room, and it will be
able to see digital elements over the room, and add your custom elements.
